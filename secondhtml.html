		<p>Kallayi is one of the rivers in Kerala, India. It originates in Cherikkulathur in the Western Ghats, at an altitude of 45 metres (148 ft) and is 40 km (24.9 mi) long. It is linked to the Chaliyar River by a man-made canal on the south side of the small timber village of Kallayi lying on its banks. The Kallayi was known for its timber businesses, but now many of these have been closed down.
        Its basin is located in the Kozhikode District.</p>

        <h4>Mananchira</h4>

        <img src="images/man.jpg" width="25%">
        <p>Mananchira is a man-made freshwater pond situated in the centre of the city of Kozhikode in Kerala, southern India. The pond is 3.49 acres (14,120 m2) in area, is rectangular in shape and is fed by a natural spring.
		Mananchira was built as a bathing pool by the Zamorin Mana Vikrama, the feudal ruler of Kozhikode in around the 14th century. The laterite obtained from excavating the pond was used to construct two palaces to the east and west.[1]
		In the late 19th century, Calicut's municipal council decreed that the pond was to be reserved exclusively for drinking purposes, and prohibited its use for bathing, washing and recreational activities—a ruling that has remained in place ever since.</p>
